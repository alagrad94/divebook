Divebook

Scuba divers keep a log of all of their dives to meet professional education requirements and to meet qualifications for more advanced certifications.  Divebook is an app for scuba divers to log the necessary details of each dive.  It also provides a place where they can upload photos from each dive and share their dive log with friends.
